# LiDAR Cone Classification Project

This repository contains my work for the **LiDAR Cone Classification Project**, where the objective is to detect and classify cone structures from **LiDAR point cloud data** using machine learning, clustering, and geometric algorithms.

The project is structured week-wise to gradually build concepts, starting from basic machine learning and moving toward clustering and robust techniques used in LiDAR perception.
